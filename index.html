    <h1> we're all those aunties that are taking care of gardens but replace the garden with the internet</h1>
    <h2> hey.... </h2>

        Akin to what I have discussed in class, I find it interesting that this article took on a more nature-based approach into the art of establishing websites. For the longest time, I have always seen websites as less of an thriving ecosystem and more as a product, something to deliver to the masses either for personal or other gains. After reading this article, I completely understood on how the internet serves as a zen garden of sorts, something to wholeheartedly nurture instead of something to cut off.

        The internet is something that we need to truly take care of, as it’s fragile branches are currently in jeopardy due to mass corporations trying to “naturalize” it. As creatives, the practice of creating websites is akin to growing a plant in a vast garden, establishing our roots in something that has a deep and rich history and thus contributing to it’s ever growing archive of personal memories. More importantly, we are able to express ourselves without any filters that the very same large companies have embedded upon us.

        Akin to the previous reading, this author takes on the approach of the web/computer as something living, as a city. Instead of taking a more naturalistic approach, i found it fascinating on how the author is able to perceive the computer as a bustling metropolis, where it’s GPUs and hard-drives resemble neighbourhoods and a multitude of building complexes.

        It further stresses the importance of seeing the language or even the very nature of computers as more than a means to an end, rather as a companion that when harnessed, is able to allow us creatives to fully harmonize with our materials and create another ecosystem, that is beneficial for our specific needs.

        We all work in systems, we all work through abstracted means of expressions, just like computers. We have an inherent language system that allows us to perform insanely complex tasks within a breakneck pace, just like computers. We all rely on harmony, just like computers. Maybe the computers that were achieved were the friends we made along the way.. This reading got me thinking about my favourite sci-fi movies, on how our creation often mimics our inherent behaviour… super cool…
